Project Proposal: Step It Up: Elevate Your Shoe Online  

The project aims to create a front-end e-commerce web application focused on providing users with a seamless shoe shopping experience. The app will include essential features such as product browsing, adding items to a shopping cart, editing cart items, and a basic checkout process (without actual payment integration). Additionally, the app will support user authentication, requiring users to log in before accessing the main functionality.
